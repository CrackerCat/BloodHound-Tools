# What is this?
A collection of tools that integrate to [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound).

Bloodhound is the defacto standard that both blue and red security teams use to find lateral movement and privilege escalation paths that can potentially be exploited inside an enterprise environment. 
A typical environment can yield millions of paths, representing almost endless opportunities for red teams to attack and creating a seemingly insurmountable number of attack vectors for blue teams to tackle. 

However, a critical dimension that Bloodhound ignores, namely network access, could hold the key to shutting down excessive lateral movement.
This repository contains tools that integrate with Bloodhoundâ€™s database in order to reflect network access, for the benefit of both red and blue teams.
